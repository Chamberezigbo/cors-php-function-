## _Understanding the cors() Function:_

The "cors()" function we provided is a PHP function that deals with CORS in the context of an API. Let's break down its key components:

- $allowedOrigins: This array contains a list of origins (domains) that are allowed to access the API. In your example, "http://localhost:3000" and "https://thetekpreneurs.com" are allowed origins.
- $origin: It captures the value of the "Origin" header sent by the client, indicating the domain from which the request originates.
- Handling CORS Requests: If the client's origin is in the list of allowed origins, the function sets the appropriate CORS headers to allow the request. These headers include "Access-Control-Allow-Origin," "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials," and "Access-Control-Max-Age." These headers inform the browser that the API is willing to accept requests from the specified origins and that credentials (e.g., cookies) can be included in the request.
-Handling OPTIONS Requests: The function also takes care of handling preflight OPTIONS requests, which are sent by the browser to check the CORS settings before making the actual request. It sets "Access-Control-Allow-Methods" and "Access-Control-Allow-Headers" headers as needed.
